jonathan 
needs to finish all user UI pages

mahesh 
help jonathan with USER ui pages
check for overlapping events 

sundera 
experiment with calaendar API
add back counter later when we do UI

sanjeet 
finish version of calendar API 
check for overlapping events 
double check and make sure upsert false for all update functions


for all date strings we expect a format of "MM/DD/YYYY 12:23"
in the UI we format and convert it to this way for the API 


User UI:
    Login Page 
    Sign Up Page
    profile page
        view main profile page
        change password page
        edit profile page
